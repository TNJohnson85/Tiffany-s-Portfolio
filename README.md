# Welcome to my portfolio

Hi!! I'm Tiffany and this is my first portfolio. I take pride in my work because these are skills I've taught myself over the past few months. I love analyzing data and it's literally become second nature to me. I'm constantly updating my portfolio to showcase my skills and growth as I learn more about data analytics. 

## Project 1: Why We Wash Our Hands
This was a project I completed that allowed me to import and clean data, create data visualizations, data manipulation, and it review case studies.

## Project 2: Word Play 
This project is still is progress but since I am a former English teacher, it made sense to create something educational.
