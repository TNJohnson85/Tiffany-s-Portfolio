# Welcome to my portfolio

Hi!! I'm Tiffany and this is my first portfolio. I take pride in my work because these are skills I've taught myself over the past few months. I love analyzing data and it's literally become second nature to me. I'm constantly updating my portfolio to showcase my skills and growth as I learn more about data analytics. 

Stay tuned for more projects!

## Project 1: Why We Wash Our Hands
This was a project I completed that allowed me to import and clean data, create data visualizations, data manipulation, and it review case studies. This was an interesting study that allowed to revew data from Dr. Semmelweis and the correlation he made between childbed fever and doctors not washing their hands.

## Project 2: Word Play 
This project is still is progress but since I am a former English teacher, it made sense to create something educational.
